# We want to know whether this script was called from the CLI or from a GUI app.
# If it is the later, we would only show the ESLint command to get the report,
# not the report itself, because GUIs tend to left a small space for pre-commit
# messages and they are not useful. At least this way, the user can see something.
#
# - First, get the caller: the process that executes the commit.
#	The command tree would be: caller > git > pre-commit script
#       so we need to get the grandparent of this script
#
# - Second, if the caller is not one of the available shells (see /etc/shells),
#	we are going to assume that it is called from a GUI app.
